I am an undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics (Class of 2027). 

I have been doing research since high school at UMBC in the [Lab for Informatics for Human Flourishing](https://flourish.umbc.edu) to quantify the quality of mother-child interactions to create an AI assisted tool to help social worker’s attachment based intervention programs. Additionally, I am interning at NIDA’s [Technology and Translational Research Unit](https://bcurtislab.com/) where I am using Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze and describe the language used in substance use disorder (SUD) recovery-focused subreddits and applying Large Language Models to analyze how social support requests are distributed across different substances.

I am also the founder and president of [Community Reads](https://ourcommunityreads.org), a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse learning environment for young children. We believe that exposure to diverse stories and characters can help children appreciate differences they see in the world and in themselves and promote a more inclusive community. As a result, our mission is to promote representation in children's literature, fostering empathy, understanding, and positive self-image among young students through engaging and educational activities. To acheive this, we work directly with Baltimore City schools and public libraries with the vison of creating a generation of children who are not only literate but also culturally aware and sensitive to the diversity that enriches our society.
