I am a medical student at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. I currently conduct research to inform guidelines for patient-centered surgical consent forms and volunteer as a clinic coordinator at the Shade Tree Free Clinic.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University in December 2021 with a B.A. in Biophysics and a Minor in Bioethics. At Johns Hopkins Hospital, I worked for the Wilmer Eye Institute's mobile free clinic and the Disability Health Research Center's *Included Podcast*. As an undergraduate student, I worked as a teaching assistant for Organic Chemistry Lab and conducted basic science cancer research for three years at the Institute for NanoBioTechnology. Additionally, I ran my own IRB-approved study called *Peer Influence on Vaping in High Schools* and independently led two COVID-19 research projects on health website accessibility and restrictive policies in fragile Middle Eastern countries. I also volunteered in a hospice center to help provide palliative care to terminally ill children. 

During the six months before medical school, I continued working at Johns Hopkins Hospital as a Research Coordinator in the Department of Pediatrics. I led research projects on parents' trust in messengers of COVID-19-related information, children’s early determinants of illness, and primary care being central to improving both health equity and civic engagement. I also worked as a Postbaccalaureate fellow in NIDA’s Technology and Translational Research Unit, where I conducted research on social media as an untapped resource for substance use discussions and the need to humanize historically marginalized people who use drugs to improve health outcomes. 

I aspire to continue leading surgical outcomes research as well as advocating for health equity and patients’ rights.
