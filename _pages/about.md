I am a medical student at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. I currently conduct research to inform guidelines for patient-centered surgical consent forms and volunteer as a clinic coordinator at [Shade Tree Free Clinic](https://www.shadetreeclinic.org/).

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University in December 2021 with a B.A. in Biophysics and a Minor in Bioethics. At Johns Hopkins Hospital, I worked at the Wilmer Eye Institute's mobile free clinic and the [Disability Health Research Center](https://disabilityhealth.jhu.edu/). As an undergraduate student, I led an Organic Chemistry Lab section as a teaching assistant and conducted basic science cancer research for three years at the [Institute for NanoBioTechnology](https://inbt.jhu.edu/). Additionally, I ran my own IRB-approved study called *Peer Influence on Vaping in High Schools* and independently led two COVID-19 research projects on health website accessibility and restrictive policies in fragile Middle Eastern countries. I also volunteered in a hospice center to help provide palliative care to terminally ill children.

During the six months before medical school, I continued working at Johns Hopkins Hospital as a research coordinator in the Department of Pediatrics. I led research projects on parents' trust in messengers of COVID-19-related information, children’s early determinants of illness, and primary care being central to improving both health equity and civic engagement. I also worked as a Postbaccalaureate fellow in NIDA’s [Technology and Translational Research Unit](https://bcurtislab.com/), where I conducted research on substance use discussions on social media and the need to humanize historically marginalized people who use drugs to improve health outcomes. 

I aspire to continue leading surgical outcomes research as well as advocating for health equity and patients’ rights.
