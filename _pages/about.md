I am a medical student at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. I currently conduct research on the essential components of surgical consent forms and volunteer as a clinic coordinator at the Shade Tree Free Clinic.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University in December 2021 with a B.A. in Biophysics and a Minor in Bioethics. At Johns Hopkins Hospital, I worked for the Wilmer Eye Institute's mobile free clinic and the Disability Health Research Center's *Included* Podcast. As an undergraduate student, I volunteered in a pediatric hospice center, led two COVID-19 research projects on health website accessibility and restrictive policies in fragile Middle Eastern countries, and ran my own IRB-approved study called *Peer Influence on Vaping in High Schools*. During the six months before medical school, I worked as a Postbaccalaureate fellow in NIDA’s Technology and Translational Research Unit where I conducted research on the language around substance use on social media and historical trends in the dehumanization of people who use drugs. Additionally, I continued working at Johns Hopkins Hospital as a Research Coordinator in the Department of Pediatrics where I led research projects on parents' trust in messengers of COVID-19-related information, children’s health trajectories and early determinants of illness, and the promotion of primary care to improve health equity and civic engagement. 

I aspire to continue conducting research on surgical outcomes as well as advocating for health equity and patients’ rights.
