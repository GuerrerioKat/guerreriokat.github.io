excerpt: 'This paper explains how to implement a hash algorithm to create anonymous but deterministic identifiers, allowing for the provision of incentives without revealing participants' identities. This easy-to-use method has implications for more efficient adn ethical research as well as expedited IRB approval if identies would have otherwise not been anonymous due to the incentive system. <br><br> *equally contributing first authors'
