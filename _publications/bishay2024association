title: "The association between motor and non-motor symptoms in essential tremor patients being evaluated for deep brain stimulation surgery"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/bishay2024association
excerpt: 'In this study of 140 patients with essential tremor undergoing evaluation for deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, we showed that tremor scores were associated with language function. Two metrics for scoring tremor severity yielded unique results. High Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) scores also correlated with increased severity in depression and visuospatial functioning. However, Washington Heights Inwood Genetic Study of Essential Tremor (WHIGET) scores showed no association with non-motor symptoms. To improve the quality of life of ET patients, future work should investigate clinically relevant differences in the unique motor symptoms captured by each metric and elucidate mechanisms underlying the association between motor impairment, cognitive impairment, and mood symptoms.'

In this study of 140 patients with essential tremor undergoing evaluation for deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, we showed that tremor scores were associated with language function. Two metrics for scoring tremor severity yielded unique results. High Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) scores also correlated with increased severity in depression and visuospatial functioning. However, Washington Heights Inwood Genetic Study of Essential Tremor (WHIGET) scores showed no association with non-motor symptoms. To improve the quality of life of ET patients, future work should investigate clinically relevant differences in the unique motor symptoms captured by each metric and elucidate mechanisms underlying the association between motor impairment, cognitive impairment, and mood symptoms.
