title: "Restriction: The COVID-19 policy type of choice for fragile Middle Eastern states"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/habib2020restriction
excerpt: 'This work examines the divergent responses to the pandemic between strong and weak states in the Middle East. Stronger states, like Qatar, implement resource-oriented policies and gradually lift restrictions, while weaker states, such as Lebanon, heavily rely on stringent restrictions due to limited infrastructure and health resources. The study highlights that fragile states implement more restrictive measures more quickly but struggle to transition to resource-oriented policies. This disparity suggests that weak states may face prolonged and less effective pandemic responses, exacerbating existing economic and political challenges. This is a non–peer-reviewed journal article as part of the <i>Open Lab on COVID-19</i>.'

This work examines the divergent responses to the pandemic between strong and weak states in the Middle East. Stronger states, like Qatar, implement resource-oriented policies and gradually lift restrictions, while weaker states, such as Lebanon, heavily rely on stringent restrictions due to limited infrastructure and health resources. The study highlights that fragile states implement more restrictive measures more quickly but struggle to transition to resource-oriented policies. This disparity suggests that weak states may face prolonged and less effective pandemic responses, exacerbating existing economic and political challenges.
