excerpt: 'This paper explains how to implement a hash algorithm to create anonymous but deterministic identifiers, allowing for the provision of incentives without revealing identities of the participants. This easy-to-use method has implications for more efficient and ethical research as well as expedited IRB approval if identities would have otherwise not been anonymous to allow for incentive distribution. <br><br> *equally contributing first authors'

This paper explains how to implement a hash algorithm to create anonymous but deterministic identifiers, allowing for the provision of incentives without revealing identities of the participants. This easy-to-use method has implications for more efficient and ethical research as well as expedited IRB approval if identities would have otherwise not been anonymous to allow for incentive distribution. <br><br> *equally contributing first authors
