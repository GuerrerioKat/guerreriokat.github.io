permalink: /publications/habib2022dyadic
excerpt: 'This paper examines how state fragility affects COVID-19 policy implementation in the Middle East. Using data from the CoronaNet Government Response Database, policies from the four strongest and six most fragile Middle Eastern countries were categorized and analyzed. Findings from the Oxford Government Response Policy Tracker and COVID-19 World Symptom Survey show that fragile states implement more restrictive policies, have lower government stringency, and lower compliance. The study highlights sectors needing humanitarian aid and questions whether restrictions in fragile states are driven by covert political agendas or a lack of political and economic power.'

This paper examines how state fragility affects COVID-19 policy implementation in the Middle East. Using data from the CoronaNet Government Response Database, policies from the four strongest and six most fragile Middle Eastern countries were categorized and analyzed. Findings from the Oxford Government Response Policy Tracker and COVID-19 World Symptom Survey show that fragile states implement more restrictive policies, have lower government stringency, and lower compliance. The study highlights sectors needing humanitarian aid and questions whether restrictions in fragile states are driven by covert political agendas or a lack of political and economic power.
