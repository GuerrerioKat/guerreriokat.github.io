collection: publications
permalink: /publications/habib2023primary
excerpt: 'This paper provides a framework for improving health and civic engagement in tandem. Social determinants of health are also drivers of lower civic engagement. Additionally, poor health is often associated with less civic engagement and vice versa. Along with addressing social determinants, primary care should be bolstered to not only improve health but also increase civic engagement indirectly via improved health status and directly via primary care voter registration programs, for example.'
