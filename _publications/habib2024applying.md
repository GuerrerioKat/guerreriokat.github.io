title: "Applying social network theory to vaping in high school: Implications for person-centered intervention"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/habib2024applying
excerpt: 'This study investigates adolescent vaping through a social influence model, focusing on gender differences within a high school network. An online survey collected data on demographics, vaping status, and friendships, and custom scripts were used to analyze the social connections. Results showed that students who vape had closer-knit friend groups, with females exhibiting greater homophily in vaping ties than males. Future large-scale studies should determine if trends can be generalized across student bodies, while more granular studies should tease apart motivations underlying these differences to individualize cessation strategies.'
