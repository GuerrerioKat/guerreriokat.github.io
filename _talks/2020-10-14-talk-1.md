This presentation highlighted cell signaling pathways that are activated when nuclei are confined during cell migration in microfluidic devices synthesized in the lab â€“ a finding that can be extrapolated to contricted passageways in the body such as pre-existing perineural spaces and bone cavities or channels created by macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts through ECM remodeling.
