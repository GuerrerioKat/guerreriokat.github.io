This presentation highlighted signaling pathways that are activated in invasive breast cancer cells when nuclei are confined during migration in synthetic microfluidic devices â€“ a finding that can be extrapolated to contricted passageways in the body such as pre-existing perineural spaces and bone cavities or channels created by macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts through ECM remodeling.
