excerpt: 'This presentation highlighted invasive breast cancer cell signaling pathways that are activated when nuclei are confined during cell migration in microfluidic devices synthesized in the lab – a finding that can be extrapolated to contricted passageways in the body such as pre-existing perineural spaces and bone cavities or channels created by macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts through ECM remodeling.

This presentation highlighted invasive breast cancer cell signaling pathways that are activated when nuclei are confined during cell migration in microfluidic devices synthesized in the lab – a finding that can be extrapolated to contricted passageways in the body such as pre-existing perineural spaces and bone cavities or channels created by macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts through ECM remodeling.
