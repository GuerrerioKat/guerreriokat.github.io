2021-11-17	AIM against survey fraud	JAMIA open	This paper explains how to implement a hash algorithm to create anonymous but deterministic identifiers, allowing for the provision of incentives without revealing participants' identities. This easy-to-use method has implications for more efficient adn ethical research as well as expedited IRB approval if identies would have otherwise not been anonymous due to the incentive system. <\n><\n> * equally contributing first authors	<b>Habib D<\b>*, Jha N*.
